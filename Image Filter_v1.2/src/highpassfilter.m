% HIGHPASSFILTER  - Constructs a high-pass butterworth filter.
%
% usage: f = highpassfilter(sze, cutoff, n)
% 
% where: sze    is a two element vector specifying the size of filter 
%               to construct.
%        cutoff is the cutoff frequency of the filter 0 - 0.5
%        n      is the order of the filter, the higher n is the sharper
%               the transition is. (n must be an integer >= 1).
%
% The frequency origin of the returned filter is at the corners.

Demo code for paper "Dominant Rotated Local Binary Patterns for Texture Classification", Rakesh Mehta & Karen Egiazarian, Pattern Recognition Letters. 

Main files:

 test_drlbp_outex.m: Matlab script to reproduce the results on Outex-10 dataset. The Outex-10 dataset cancan be downloaded from http://www.outex.oulu.fi/index.php?page=classification.
                     Save the dataset in the same directory as the code and run the script. The same code can also be sued for Outex-12 dataset by adding the appropriate dataset path.


 rlbp.m :            The Rotated Local Binary Pattern operator function. 

 get_dominant_idx.m: Function returns the dominant patterns indices.
